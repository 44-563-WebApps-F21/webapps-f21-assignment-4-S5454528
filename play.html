    <h5>Act 4 </h5>
    <h5>Description : Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house</h5>
    <p>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
            bell_.]</p> <p>It is a great nuisance. I can’t find any one in this house to
                talk to. And I am full of interesting information. I feel like the
                latest edition of something or other.</p>

        <p>[_Enter servant_.]</p>

        <h6>JAMES.</h6> <p>Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>

        <h6>JAMES.</h6> <p>Her ladyship has not yet left her room. Miss Chiltern has just
            come in from riding.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_To himself_.]</p> <p>Ah! that is something.</p>

        <h6>JAMES.</h6> <p>Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
            Robert. I told him your lordship was here.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>Thank you! Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>

        <h6>JAMES.</h6> <p>[_Bowing_.]</p> <p>I shall do so, my lord.</p>

        <p>[_Exit servant_.]</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
            It is a great deal too much excitement for any son. I hope to goodness
            he won’t come up. Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the
            only proper basis for family life. Mothers are different. Mothers are
            darlings.</p> <p>[_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
                begins to read it_.]</p>

        <p>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>

        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p>Well, sir, what are you doing here? Wasting your time
            as usual, I suppose?</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p> <p>My dear father, when one
            pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
            one’s own.</p>

        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p>Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
            last night?</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>

        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p>Engaged to be married yet?</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Genially_.]</p> <p>Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>

        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p>[_Caustically_.]</p> <p>You can have till dinner-time if it
            would be of any convenience to you.</p>

        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
            lunch.</p>
