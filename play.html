            <h5>Act 4 </h5>
            <h5>Description : Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house</h5>
            <p>
                LORD GORING.  [_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
bell_.]  It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
latest edition of something or other.<br>

[_Enter servant_.]<br>

JAMES.  Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.<br>

LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern not down yet?<br>

JAMES.  Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
come in from riding.<br>

LORD GORING.  [_To himself_.]  Ah! that is something.<br>

JAMES.  Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.<br>

LORD GORING.  Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?<br>

JAMES.  [_Bowing_.]  I shall do so, my lord.<br>

[_Exit servant_.]<br>

LORD GORING.  Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
darlings.  [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
begins to read it_.]<br>

[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]<br>

LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
as usual, I suppose?<br>

LORD GORING.  [_Throws down paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one
pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
one’s own.<br>

LORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
last night?<br>

LORD GORING.  I have been thinking about nothing else.<br>

LORD CAVERSHAM.  Engaged to be married yet?<br>

LORD GORING.  [_Genially_.]  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.<br>

LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Caustically_.]  You can have till dinner-time if it
would be of any convenience to you.<br>

LORD GORING.  Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
lunch.
